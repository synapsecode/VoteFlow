## The Future
This project was a big success and after that I moved onto something else. However, I do plan on Creating a Version 2 of Voteflow which will have even more options and will be secure enough to be used in more widespread usecases. That will not be opensource and will have a radically different tech stack to account for enterprise use.

## Outcome
I used Voteflow to run my School Cabinet Election for the year 2019. It was a massive success. Completely Flawless and as a result, I was felicitated by my School **St Paul's English School, Bangalore**.
